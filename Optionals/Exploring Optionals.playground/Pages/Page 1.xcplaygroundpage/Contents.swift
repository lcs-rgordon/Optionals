 ## Variable initialization
 
 - Callout(Essential Question):
 What is the difference between an optional String and a regular String?
 
 ### Experiment #1
 Read the code shown in the screenshot below.
 
 ![declare-no-value](declare-no-value.png)
 
 Type that same code beginning on line 18.
 
 */
// Type the code below this line

/*:
 
 Now, run the playground using the *Command-Shift-Return* keyboard shortcut.
 
 Then open the debug area using the *Command-Shift-Y* keyboard shortcut.
 
 Did you see output similar to the following?
  
 ![variable-not-initialized](error.png)
 
 NOTE: You may need to scroll up a bit in the debug area.
 
 What do you think the error means?
 
 Now comment out the code above from experiment #1.
 
 Then type the following instead:
 
 ![declare-optional](declare-optional.png)
 
 */
// Type the second code example below...

/*:
 
 Run the playground again.
 
 You will notice a warning appears:
 
 ![coerced](coerced.png)
 
 Aside from that warning, focus on the result shown in the debug area.
 
 How does the result shown from the second block of code differ from the result you got when running the first block of code?
 
 Write a response to this question in your black notebook.
